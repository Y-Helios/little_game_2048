# little_game_2048

### introduction
- This is a classic game named 2048. And it was my final course program for my freshman year, so the code looks ugly.
- This work was complished by another classmate and me, and was compiled by vs2019. 
- And I upload it now as an archive.

### usage

- Just open the file and run `ConsoleApplication1.sln`
- This game supports the use of the arrow keys and `aswd` keys to play.

### others

This person is too lazy to write other points.
